# YouTube â†’ Blog (GitHub Pages + Jekyll)

This repo turns your YouTube channel RSS feed into blog posts on a GitHub Pages site.  
Every video gets a post with:
- Title
- Embedded YouTube player
- Thumbnail (image)
- Description (auto-copied from YouTube)

## Quick Start

1. **Use this repo as a template** or upload the ZIP to a new GitHub repository.
2. In `_config.yml`, set `yt_feed_url` to your YouTube RSS URL. Example:
   ```yml
   yt_feed_url: "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
   ```
   To find your channel ID, open your channel page and look for `/channel/UCxxxx` in the URL.
3. Commit and push. GitHub Actions will run the workflow and generate posts in `_posts/`.
4. Enable **GitHub Pages** in your repo settings (build from `GitHub Actions` or `main` branch).
5. Visit your site! (For user/organization pages, the URL is `https://<username>.github.io`.)

## How it works
- A GitHub Action runs `scripts/rss_to_posts.py` on every push and once a day.
- It reads the `yt_feed_url` from `_config.yml`, fetches the RSS, and creates Markdown posts in `_posts/`.
- If new videos appear, it commits the new posts and redeploys Pages automatically.

## Customize
- Change the site name and theme in `_config.yml`. Default theme is `minima` (supported by GitHub Pages).
- Edit `_layouts/post.html` to tweak the embed and layout.
- Want summarized or truncated descriptions? Edit `rss_to_posts.py`.

## Notes
- This uses only official GitHub Pages-supported Jekyll features.
- No custom Jekyll plugins are required (posts are pre-generated by the workflow).
- Thumbnails and descriptions are pulled directly from the feed when available.# el-omari-lakbir
